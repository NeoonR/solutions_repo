# Problem 1
# Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

## Motivation

Calculating equivalent resistance is fundamental in electrical circuits for understanding and design. Traditional series and parallel simplifications become cumbersome for complex networks. Graph theory provides a systematic, algorithmic way to analyze and simplify circuits by representing them as graphs, enabling automatic handling of complex resistor configurations.

## Task Description

Implement an algorithm that:

- Accepts a circuit represented as a graph (nodes = junctions, edges = resistors with resistance weights).
- Iteratively simplifies the graph using series and parallel resistor reductions.
- Handles nested series and parallel connections.
- Outputs the final equivalent resistance between two terminal nodes.

---

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Represent the circuit as a graph:**
    - Nodes = junction points
    - Edges = resistors, weighted by resistance value.

2. **Iterative reduction:**
    - **Parallel reduction:** Multiple edges between the same two nodes are combined into a single edge with equivalent resistance.
    - **Series reduction:** Nodes connected to exactly two neighbors (not terminals) are removed by replacing the two series resistors with one resistor equal to their sum.

3. **Repeat reductions until only two nodes remain connected by a single edge.**

## Pseudocode

```text
function equivalent_resistance(graph, node1, node2):
    while graph has more than 2 nodes:
        # Reduce parallel edges
        for each pair of nodes connected by multiple edges:
            combine all parallel resistors into one resistor
        
        # Reduce series nodes
        for each node except node1 and node2:
            if node degree == 2:
                neighbors = [n1, n2]
                Req = resistance(node-n1) + resistance(node-n2)
                remove node and its edges
                add edge between n1 and n2 with Req
                
        if no reduction occurred:
            break
    
    return resistance of edge between node1 and node2

**The algorithm:**

    Cannot collapse series at first due to high node degrees.

    Combines parallel edges if any (not here).

    Then terminates when no series/parallel pattern is found.

âœ… Works as long as a solution path exists (edge Aâ€“C exists).
    arallel Resistor Reduction:

        For each node pair, combine all parallel edges.

        At most O(E) operations per iteration, where E is the number of edges.

    Series Resistor Reduction:

        For each node (excluding terminals), check if its degree is exactly 2.

        Series reduction requires checking node neighbors and combining two edges.

        Up to O(N) per iteration, where N is the number of nodes.

    Iterations:

        The process repeats until no further reductions are possible.

        In the worst case, it can iterate O(N) times as the graph reduces.

Overall Complexity:

O(R Ã— (N + E)),
where R is the number of reduction rounds.

    In practice, R is usually small for well-structured circuits, so the algorithm performs efficiently on most inputs.
